# Next-Pokemon-App
This project was developed following [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdXKz1UWc3E) youtube tutorial.

## 🚩 Objective

The objective of this project was trying out **SSR** (Server Side Rendering) page generation using Next.js framework.

## 🛠 Technologies used

### Language:

- Javascript/Typescript

### Framework: 
- Next.js

## ✔️ What does the application do?

The application uses the [PokeAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) pokemon API as datasource.\
In this application there are two pages:
- Home page where we can find a grid layout that displays only the first ten pokemon.
- Details page, accessible by clicking the detail button of a pokemon in the home page, that displays the details about the pokemon.\
These pages are generated by the server therefore only the html will be sent to the clients.
